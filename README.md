# Basic-Chat-Bot

![Image of ChatBot](https://i.imgur.com/oXwt3Z6.png)


Description: This bot learns from existing data, parses the user's response, assigns revelance scores to the user's response, and picks a random response from the category that the user's response most correlates with. This is basically the bag of words method. The next step is to turn this into a discord bot with the discord API.

Tools: python, tensorflow, tflearn, pickle, nltk, and numpy

Warning: You need to pip install ntlk, tensorflow (vers 1.14), tflearn, and numpy. In addtion, it's recommended that you use this with python 3.6.4 if you run into errors. I used anaconda to create an environment with python 3.6.4.

1. conda create -n chatbot python=3.6.4
2. conda activate chatbot
3. pip install the plugins
