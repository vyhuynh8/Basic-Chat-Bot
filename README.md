# Basic-Chat-Bot


Description: This bot learns from existing data, parses the user's response, assigns revelance scores to the user's response, and picks a random response from the category that the user's response most correlates with. This is basically the bag of words method. The next step is to turn this into a discord bot with the discord API.

Tools: python, tensorflow, tflearn, pickle, nltk, and numpy
